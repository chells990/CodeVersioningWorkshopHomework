# CodeVersioningWorkshopHomework

This task covered the importance of version control strategies, collaborative development workflows, and effective communication within a team. It covered the entire process from branching, merging and making changes to resolving conflicts, initiating pull requests, conducting code reviews, and actively collaborating with team members on a shared repository. 

* Challenges Faced and Overcoming Them:
Encountered confusion when only the main branch was visible after pushing to GitHub to overcome this i explicitly pushing each branch to the remote repository using git push origin branch_name.
